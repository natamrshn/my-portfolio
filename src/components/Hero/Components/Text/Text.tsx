        Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer with 1.5+ year of commercial experience,
        specializing in React and TypeScript. At my previous company, I improved
        page load speed by 30% through API optimization and lazy loading. I also
        developed a design system that reduced feature development time by 25%.
        In my latest project, my team and I launched a socks sales website with
        an admin panel for product and order management. I excel at integrating
        REST APIs, handling asynchronous operations, and optimizing state
        management using Redux and Context API. I work well in Agile teams,
        collaborating via Jira, Git, and Figma.
